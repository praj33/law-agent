## ⚠️ **CURRENT ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

### **1. Grok API Key Issue**
- **Problem:** Using placeholder API key `your-grok-api-key-here`
- **Solution:** Get real API key from https://console.x.ai/
- **Status:** System falls back to advanced structured responses

### **2. Minor Interface Mismatches**
- **Problem:** Some method name differences between systems
- **Solution:** Interface adapters implemented (mostly working)
- **Status:** 90% resolved, minor edge cases remain

### **3. Constitutional Articles File**
- **Problem:** `article.json` file path issue
- **Solution:** File copied but path needs adjustment
- **Status:** Advanced constitutional advisor working with fallback
