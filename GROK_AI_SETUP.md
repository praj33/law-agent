## üéâ **BEFORE vs AFTER COMPARISON**

### ‚ùå **BEFORE (The Problem)**
```
Query: "I want to file for divorce"
Response: "This matter falls under family law and requires specialized legal attention. 
Please consult with a qualified attorney."
```

### ‚úÖ **AFTER (The Solution)**
```
Query: "I want to file for divorce"
Response: 
**Legal Analysis:**
Divorce proceedings require establishing valid grounds such as irreconcilable differences, 
adultery, or abandonment. You'll need to file a petition in your state's family court.

**Next Steps:**
1. Gather marriage certificate, financial records, and asset documentation
2. Determine grounds for divorce under your state's laws
3. File divorce petition in appropriate family court jurisdiction
4. Serve papers to spouse and await response
5. Consider mediation for uncontested divorce

**Timeline:**
- Uncontested divorce: 3-6 months
- Contested divorce: 1-3 years depending on complexity

**Important:**
Property division, child custody, and alimony vary by state. Consider legal counsel 
for complex financial situations.
