## üéØ **WHAT YOU'LL GET WITH REAL GROK API KEY**

### **Current Improved Responses (Without Grok):**
```
Query: "I want to file for divorce"
Response: "Divorce proceedings require establishing legal grounds and following 
state-specific procedures. Common grounds include irreconcilable differences..."
```

### **With Real Grok AI (Even Better):**
```
Query: "I want to file for divorce"
Response: "Based on your specific situation, here's what you need to know:

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Determine if you meet your state's residency requirements (typically 6 months)
2. Decide on grounds - no-fault (irreconcilable differences) vs fault-based
3. Gather financial documents: last 3 years tax returns, bank statements, 
   retirement accounts, property deeds, debt statements

LEGAL STRATEGY:
- If uncontested: Consider online divorce services or mediation ($500-2000)
- If contested: Expect 12-24 months, $15,000-50,000 in legal fees
- Property division follows your state's law (community property vs equitable distribution)

TIMELINE & COSTS:
- Filing fee: $200-400
- Uncontested: 2-6 months
- Contested with children: 12-24 months
- Mediation: $100-300/hour vs attorney: $250-500/hour

CRITICAL DEADLINES:
- Response to petition: 20-30 days (varies by state)
- Financial disclosures: 60-90 days
- Temporary orders hearing: 2-4 weeks if requested

This analysis is based on general divorce law principles. Consult a family law 
attorney in your jurisdiction for advice specific to your situation."
